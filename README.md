# Dog-breed-competition-with-only-the-pretrained-models-from-imagenet
This post describe the method and tips I got from participanting in the Dog Breed challengeDog Breed challenge in Kaggle. I managed to get an final score of 0.13783, which sets me in the 158 postion, considering a lot of competitors are leveraging the 3-rd party dataset(which already contain the test data), I believe my approach worth sharing cause there is nothing else being used except the pretrained imagenet models.(However, there are a ensembles :O)
